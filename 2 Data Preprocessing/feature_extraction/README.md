# Feature Extraction

1. Load a raw header files as a string
2. To run import either the main.py or the module but get to the parse_email()
3. Feed in string header to parse_email_header()
4. feed that output into data_extractor_data()
5. run quantify_normalize() with the output from that

PS. If you want examples, this module is integrated into the Application and is being used, the code is in 4 Application/model/main.py starting at line 14.
